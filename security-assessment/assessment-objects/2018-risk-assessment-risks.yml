      summary: Lack of visibility on how user endpoint systems/devices are configured
      description:
        (sample text)
        Endpoint systems should be configured according to the company's IT and
        security standards. Because currently all enduser systems (e.g. laptops)
        are self managed, there is a lack of centralized visibility into how
        each system is configured and if they meet the compliance requirements

      details:
        'Systems should be configured with at least the following:'

          1. Disk encryption enabled
          2. Screensaver protection/screen lock on
          3. Local firewall enabled
          4. Remote login disabled
          5. Auto install OS security patches enabled
          6. (if it is Windows) Has Windows Defender or equivalent malware protection running
